<h1>Big Tech's $625 Billion AI Bet Is Already in Your Portfolio</h1>

<p>Microsoft's revenue backlog just grew to <strong>$625 billion</strong>, a <strong>60%</strong> increase in a single quarter. The company also disclosed that <strong>45%</strong> of that backlogâroughly <strong>$281 billion</strong>âis tied to a single customer: <strong>OpenAI</strong>.</p>

<p>This is not an isolated event. Meta plans to spend up to <strong>$135 billion</strong> on capital projects by 2026. Amazon continues to fund new AI infrastructure. Across the technology sector, the numbers point to a massive, coordinated buildout of chips, servers, and data centers.</p>

<p>If your portfolio holds the S&P 500 or a large-cap growth fund, you own this bet. The risk is owning it unintentionally, in the wrong size, at the wrong cost.</p>

<p><em>Companies mentioned are for educational purposes, not recommendations to buy or sell securities.</em></p>

<h2>The Real Cost of AI: An Infrastructure Arms Race</h2>

<p>AI is not just a software update; it is a massive infrastructure project that requires immense capital.</p>

<p>Microsoft spent <strong>$37.5 billion</strong> on capital expenditures in its most recent quarter, up <strong>66%</strong> year over year, with most of it funding servers and chips. Its free cash flow fell as spending rose. Meta projected <strong>$162â$169 billion</strong> of total expenses in 2025, driven by infrastructure costs and the talent to run it.</p>

<p>This spending can create durable businesses. It can also create low-return assets and intense margin pressure. Excitement about technology doesn't pay dividends. Cash flow exceeding expectations does.</p>

<h2>Revenue Growth Has a Price</h2>

<p>The recent revenue growth is undeniable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft: <strong>$81.3 billion</strong> revenue, <strong>17%</strong> growth</li>
<li>Meta: <strong>$59.8 billion</strong> revenue, <strong>24%</strong> growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are real numbers. But they come at a cost.</p>

<p>When capital spending rises this quickly, <em>shareholders fund the buildout first</em>. Profits may or may not follow. Even when new technologies succeed, competition eventually pushes prices down and returns settle closer to average. This is the core risk of an arms race: each firm spends to avoid falling behind, not because the returns on that capital are certain.</p>

<h2>Concentration Risk Inside Your "Diversified" Fund</h2>

<p>Many investors still see the S&P 500 as 500 independent companies. It has become a top-heavy index whose performance swings on the fortunes of a few mega-cap technology firms.</p>

<p>This concentration happened through drift, not by design. As tech stocks outperformed, market-cap weighted index funds mechanically bought more of them. Portfolios that started balanced became tech-heavy without a single active decision.</p>

<p>This AI buildout adds a second layer of concentration, as many of the same top companies make the same capital-intensive bet at the same time. Owning the market gives you exposure. The danger is owning far more than you realize through overlapping, concentrated funds.</p>

<h2>Deconstructing the $625 Billion Backlog</h2>

<p>The term "backlog" implies certainty. The reality is more complex.</p>

<p>Backlog is a mix of contracted commitments, revenue timing assumptions, and customer credit risk. Microsoft expects its backlog to convert to revenue over an average of <strong>2.5 years</strong>. Again, <strong>45%</strong> of that total relies on a single counterparty.</p>

<p>This raises questions investors cannot answer from the outside:</p>

<ul>
<li>How stable is the customer's funding and long-term demand?</li>
<li>What happens if the customer renegotiates contract terms?</li>
<li>How will new competition affect future pricing power?</li>
</ul>

<p>While backlog is a meaningful indicator, it is not cash in the bank.</p>

<h2>A Historical Parallel: The Dot-Com Buildout</h2>

<p>In the late 1990s, companies poured billions into internet infrastructure. The technology fundamentally changed the economy. Yet investors in those companies suffered deep, prolonged drawdowns because valuations ran far ahead of realized profits.</p>

<p>Being right about a technology's direction does not guarantee a positive return from owning its stock at today's prices.</p>

<p>We are not forecasting a market crash. We are highlighting the structure of the risk: high expectations, high spending, and tight competition create a narrow path to success for investors.</p>

<h2>How Evidence-Based Investors Respond</h2>

<p>Our role at ArcVest is to apply a consistent framework, not to chase headlines. It is to keep clients from getting pulled into the <strong>Fee Extraction Machine</strong> that appears whenever a story gets popularâtheme funds, structured products, and "exclusive" private deals designed to harvest fees.</p>

<p>Evidence-based investing looks boring because it refuses to pretend we can reliably pick tomorrow's winners. Two pieces of evidence guide our approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Active manager underperformance is persistent.</strong> Over 15â20 year periods, the vast majority of active U.S. equity managers fail to beat their benchmarks after fees. (Source: <em>S&P Dow Jones Indices, SPIVA U.S. Scorecard</em>, various editions.)</li>
<li><strong>After costs, active management is a negative-sum game.</strong> Before costs, the collective return of all active investors equals the market return. After costs, their collective return must trail the market. (Source: William F. Sharpe, <em>The Arithmetic of Active Management</em>, 1991.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This evidence doesn't argue against owning technology. It argues against betting your financial plan on being the rare exception who can outsmart the market.</p>

<p>So we <strong>buy the haystack</strong>: a broadly diversified, global portfolio at the lowest possible cost, managed with a rules-based rebalancing discipline.</p>

<h2>Practical Steps for Your Portfolio</h2>

<h3>1. Measure Your True Exposure</h3>

<p>Look through every account: taxable, retirement, trusts, and workplace plans. Add up your overlapping holdings in S&P 500 funds, large-cap growth funds, technology sector funds, single stocks</p>
