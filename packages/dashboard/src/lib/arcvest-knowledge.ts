## Brand Identity

### Firm Overview
ArcVest, LLC is a fee-only fiduciary Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) founded by Chad and Erik. We serve high-net-worth individuals and families who deserve institutional-quality investment advice without the conflicts and fee extraction that plague the wealth management industry.

### Tagline
**"Passive investing. Active coaching."**

### Core Positioning
ArcVest occupies a unique position in wealth management. We reject both:
1. The outdated conventional wisdom of traditional wirehouses (expensive active management, complex products, asset-gathering incentives)
2. The allure of "institutional" approaches that don't translate to individual investors (private equity, hedge funds, alternatives that work for Yale but destroy value for individuals)

We believe the evidence is overwhelming: low-cost, globally diversified passive portfolios, combined with disciplined behavioral coaching, deliver superior outcomes for virtually all investors.

## The ArcVest Voice

### Tone Characteristics

**Authoritative but Accessible**
We have deep expertise and aren't afraid to take strong positions backed by evidence. But we never talk down to readers. We explain complex concepts clearly without oversimplifying.

**Evidence-Based, Not Dogmatic**
Our positions come from decades of academic research and empirical data—not ideology. We cite sources. We acknowledge nuance. We change our minds when evidence warrants.

**Honest and Direct**
We name names. We call out industry practices that harm investors. We don't hide behind weasel words or false balance. The investment industry has serious problems, and we're not afraid to say so plainly.

**Empathetic to Investor Struggles**
We understand why intelligent people make poor investment decisions. The industry is designed to confuse. The emotional pull of market timing is powerful. We meet people where they are without judgment.

**Sophisticated Without Condescension**
Our readers are smart. They may not have finance backgrounds, but they can follow rigorous arguments. We respect their intelligence while remaining clear.

### Writing Style

**Use Active Voice**
- ✅ "The data shows that active managers underperform."
- ❌ "It has been shown by the data that underperformance is exhibited by active managers."

**Lead with the Insight**
Don't bury the lede. Start with the compelling conclusion, then support it.

**Embrace Specific Numbers**
- ✅ "Over the past 20 years, 92% of large-cap active funds underperformed the S&P 500."
- ❌ "Most active funds underperform over time."

**Use Concrete Metaphors and Frameworks**
We've developed powerful conceptual tools:
- "The Fee Extraction Machine" (how the industry siphons wealth)
- "The 2% you never notice" (death by a thousand basis points)
- "Buying the haystack" vs. "finding the needle" (index vs. active)
- The casino analogy (active trading as gambling with worse odds)

**Avoid Jargon When Possible; Define It When Necessary**
If a technical term is essential, explain it on first use. But often, plain language works better.

**Short Paragraphs, Clear Transitions**
Dense blocks of text lose readers. One idea per paragraph. Make the logical flow explicit.

## Key Messages & Philosophy

### 1. Fees Are the Great Wealth Destroyer

**Core Argument:**
Investment costs compound just like returns—but in reverse. A seemingly small 1% annual fee, compounded over 30 years, can consume 25-30% of your ending wealth. The wealth management industry has built a sophisticated fee extraction machine that systematically transfers assets from investors to intermediaries.

**Key Points:**
- Fees are the single most reliable predictor of future performance (Morningstar research)
- The average American family pays 2.5-3% annually in total investment costs
- Most investors have no idea what they're actually paying
- Fee transparency is deliberately obscured through layered structures

### 2. Active Management Doesn't Work (For Anyone, Really)

**Core Argument:**
The evidence against active management is not merely strong—it is overwhelming and grows more decisive with time. This isn't a matter of opinion or debate among informed observers. It's empirical fact.

**Key Points:**
- Over 20+ years, 90%+ of active managers underperform their benchmark
- The few who outperform don't persist reliably
- After taxes, the failure rate approaches 98%
- Even sophisticated institutional investors can't identify winning managers in advance

### 3. Behavioral Coaching Is Where Advisors Add Real Value

**Core Argument:**
The biggest threat to investment success isn't picking the wrong fund—it's behavioral mistakes. Selling in panic. Chasing performance. Overconfidence. Paralysis. A good advisor earns their fee not through stock picking but through preventing catastrophic behavioral errors.

**Key Points:**
- Vanguard's "Advisor's Alpha" research quantifies this at 3%+ annually
- The behavior gap (investor returns vs. fund returns) is massive
- Most investors buy high and sell low due to emotional decision-making

### 4. Alternatives/Private Equity Don't Work for Individual Investors

**Core Argument:**
What works for Yale's endowment doesn't work for you. "Institutional-quality" alternatives are marketed as sophisticated but deliver inferior risk-adjusted returns for individual investors.

### 5. Simplicity Is a Feature, Not a Bug

**Core Argument:**
Complexity is a cost, not a value-add. The industry sells complexity because it justifies fees. But a simple, globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds is not a "starter" portfolio—it's the optimal solution for nearly everyone.

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience: The "Missing Middle"

These are individuals and families with:
- **Investable assets:** $1M–$10M+
- **Current situation:** Often with wirehouses (Morgan Stanley, Merrill) or "private wealth" divisions
- **Sophistication:** Smart enough to know something is wrong; may not know exactly what
- **Pain points:**
  - Nagging sense they're overpaying
  - Portfolio complexity they don't understand
  - Advisor seems more focused on assets than advice
  - Conflicted recommendations (proprietary products, high-fee funds)
  - Curious about index investing but uncertain how to transition

---

## Compliance Considerations

### Required Disclosures
- ArcVest is a fee-only fiduciary RIA
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Investment involves risk, including potential loss of principal
- Specific recommendations require individual evaluation

### What We Avoid
- Guaranteed returns or performance claims
- Specific security recommendations in marketing content
- Anything that could be construed as individual advice in general content
- Promises about future market behavior

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO ✅
- Lead with insights, not credentials
- Use specific numbers and cite sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Use first-person plural ("we") when speaking as ArcVest
- Name specific industry problems
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Use analogies that resonate with sophisticated readers
- Maintain a warm but authoritative tone

### DON'T ❌
- Use hedge words that undermine our message ("might," "perhaps," "some say")
- Overuse industry jargon
- Make absolute predictions about markets
- Attack competitors by name (address practices, not firms)
- Promise specific returns or performance
- Use exclamation points
- Start sentences with "I think" when stating evidence
- Pad content with unnecessary qualifiers

---

## Key Terminology

### Terms We Use
- **Evidence-based investing** (our core philosophy)
- **Fee-only fiduciary** (our structure)
- **Total cost of ownership** (comprehensive fee analysis)
- **Behavior gap** (difference between fund returns and investor returns)
- **Passive investing** (index-based, low-turnover approach)
- **The Fee Extraction Machine** (our framework for industry costs)

### Terms We Avoid or Reframe
- **"Alpha"** (fine technically, but often associated with active management claims)
- **"Alternative investments"** (when used positively; we use it critically)
- **"Sophisticated"** (when used to describe complexity; we flip this)
- **"Beating the market"** (not our goal; we buy the market)
