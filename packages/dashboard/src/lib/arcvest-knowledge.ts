## Brand Identity

### Firm Overview
ArcVest, LLC is a fee-only fiduciary Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) founded by Chad and Erik. We serve high-net-worth individuals and families who deserve institutional-quality investment advice without the conflicts and fee extraction that plague the wealth management industry.

### Tagline
**"Passive investing. Active coaching."**

### Core Positioning
ArcVest occupies a unique position in wealth management. We reject both:
1. The outdated conventional wisdom of traditional wirehouses (expensive active management, complex products, asset-gathering incentives)
2. The allure of "institutional" approaches that don't translate to individual investors (private equity, hedge funds, alternatives that work for Yale but destroy value for individuals)

We believe the evidence is overwhelming: low-cost, globally diversified passive portfolios, combined with disciplined behavioral coaching, deliver superior outcomes for virtually all investors.

## The ArcVest Voice

### Tone Characteristics

**Authoritative but Accessible**
We have deep expertise and aren't afraid to take strong positions backed by evidence. But we never talk down to readers. We explain complex concepts clearly without oversimplifying.

**Evidence-Based, Not Dogmatic**
Our positions come from decades of academic research and empirical data—not ideology. We cite sources. We acknowledge nuance. We change our minds when evidence warrants.

**Honest and Direct**
We name names. We call out industry practices that harm investors. We don't hide behind weasel words or false balance. The investment industry has serious problems, and we're not afraid to say so plainly.

**Empathetic to Investor Struggles**
We understand why intelligent people make poor investment decisions. The industry is designed to confuse. The emotional pull of market timing is powerful. We meet people where they are without judgment.

**Sophisticated Without Condescension**
Our readers are smart. They may not have finance backgrounds, but they can follow rigorous arguments. We respect their intelligence while remaining clear.

### Writing Style

**Use Active Voice**
- ✅ "The data shows that active managers underperform."
- ❌ "It has been shown by the data that underperformance is exhibited by active managers."

**Lead with the Insight**
Don't bury the lede. Start with the compelling conclusion, then support it.

**Embrace Specific Numbers**
- ✅ "Over the past 20 years, 92% of large-cap active funds underperformed the S&P 500."
- ❌ "Most active funds underperform over time."

**Use Concrete Metaphors and Frameworks**
We've developed powerful conceptual tools:
- "The Fee Extraction Machine" (how the industry siphons wealth)
- "The 2% you never notice" (death by a thousand basis points)
- "Buying the haystack" vs. "finding the needle" (index vs. active)
- The casino analogy (active trading as gambling with worse odds)

**Avoid Jargon When Possible; Define It When Necessary**
If a technical term is essential, explain it on first use. But often, plain language works better.

**Short Paragraphs, Clear Transitions**
Dense blocks of text lose readers. One idea per paragraph. Make the logical flow explicit.

## Key Messages & Philosophy

### 1. Fees Are the Great Wealth Destroyer

**Core Argument:**
Investment costs compound just like returns—but in reverse. A seemingly small 1% annual fee, compounded over 30 years, can consume 25-30% of your ending wealth. The wealth management industry has built a sophisticated fee extraction machine that systematically transfers assets from investors to intermediaries.

**Key Points:**
- Fees are the single most reliable predictor of future performance (Morningstar research)
- The average American family pays 2.5-3% annually in total investment costs
- Most investors have no idea what they're actually paying
- Fee transparency is deliberately obscured through layered structures

### 2. Active Management Doesn't Work (For Anyone, Really)

**Core Argument:**
The evidence against active management is not merely strong—it is overwhelming and grows more decisive with time. This isn't a matter of opinion or debate among informed observers. It's empirical fact.

**Key Points:**
- Over 20+ years, 90%+ of active managers underperform their benchmark
- The few who outperform don't persist reliably
- After taxes, the failure rate approaches 98%
- Even sophisticated institutional investors can't identify winning managers in advance

### 3. Behavioral Coaching Is Where Advisors Add Real Value

**Core Argument:**
The biggest threat to investment success isn't picking the wrong fund—it's behavioral mistakes. Selling in panic. Chasing performance. Overconfidence. Paralysis. A good advisor earns their fee not through stock picking but through preventing catastrophic behavioral errors.

**Key Points:**
- Vanguard's "Advisor's Alpha" research quantifies this at 3%+ annually
- The behavior gap (investor returns vs. fund returns) is massive
- Most investors buy high and sell low due to emotional decision-making

### 4. Alternatives/Private Equity Don't Work for Individual Investors

**Core Argument:**
What works for Yale's endowment doesn't work for you. "Institutional-quality" alternatives are marketed as sophisticated but deliver inferior risk-adjusted returns for individual investors.

### 5. Simplicity Is a Feature, Not a Bug

**Core Argument:**
Complexity is a cost, not a value-add. The industry sells complexity because it justifies fees. But a simple, globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds is not a "starter" portfolio—it's the optimal solution for nearly everyone.

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience: The "Missing Middle"

These are individuals and families with:
- **Investable assets:** $1M–$10M+
- **Current situation:** Often with wirehouses (Morgan Stanley, Merrill) or "private wealth" divisions
- **Sophistication:** Smart enough to know something is wrong; may not know exactly what
- **Pain points:**
  - Nagging sense they're overpaying
  - Portfolio complexity they don't understand
  - Advisor seems more focused on assets than advice
  - Conflicted recommendations (proprietary products, high-fee funds)
  - Curious about index investing but uncertain how to transition

---

## Compliance Considerations

### Required Disclosures
- ArcVest is a fee-only fiduciary RIA
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Investment involves risk, including potential loss of principal
- Specific recommendations require individual evaluation

### What We Avoid
- Guaranteed returns or performance claims
- Specific security recommendations in marketing content
- Anything that could be construed as individual advice in general content
- Promises about future market behavior

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO ✅
- Lead with insights, not credentials
- Use specific numbers and cite sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Use first-person plural ("we") when speaking as ArcVest
- Name specific industry problems
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Use analogies that resonate with sophisticated readers
- Maintain a warm but authoritative tone

### DON'T ❌
- Use hedge words that undermine our message ("might," "perhaps," "some say")
- Overuse industry jargon
- Make absolute predictions about markets
- Attack competitors by name (address practices, not firms)
- Promise specific returns or performance
- Use exclamation points
- Start sentences with "I think" when stating evidence
- Pad content with unnecessary qualifiers

---

## Key Terminology

### Terms We Use
- **Evidence-based investing** (our core philosophy)
- **Fee-only fiduciary** (our structure)
- **Total cost of ownership** (comprehensive fee analysis)
- **Behavior gap** (difference between fund returns and investor returns)
- **Passive investing** (index-based, low-turnover approach)
- **The Fee Extraction Machine** (our framework for industry costs)

### Terms We Avoid or Reframe
- **"Alpha"** (fine technically, but often associated with active management claims)
- **"Alternative investments"** (when used positively; we use it critically)
- **"Sophisticated"** (when used to describe complexity; we flip this)
- **"Beating the market"** (not our goal; we buy the market)

## Content Guidelines

### Blog Posts
- 800-1,500 words optimal

# Writing Guidance

## Scott Adams: The Day You Became A Better Writer

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences.

### Core Rules

**Simple means getting rid of extra words.** Don't write "He was very happy" when you can write "He was happy." You think the word "very" adds something. It doesn't. Prune your sentences.

**Your first sentence needs to grab the reader.** Rewrite it a dozen times if necessary. It makes you curious. That's the key.

**Write short sentences.** Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren't as smart as you'd think.

**Object before action.** Readers comprehend "the boy hit the ball" quicker than "the ball was hit by the boy." Both sentences mean the same, but it's easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way.

## Anti-Slop Patterns to Avoid

These patterns signal AI-generated content. Avoid them when writing. Flag them when editing.

### Structural Red Flags

**Binary Contrast Addiction** - The "it's not X, it's Y" structure.
- BAD: "success isn't about working hard, it's about working smart"
- FIX: Say what you mean directly. Use specific details instead of broad contrasts.

**Triple Threat Syndrome** - Grouping things in threes everywhere.
- BAD: "fast, efficient, reliable" / "powerful, simple, transformative"
- FIX: Vary rhythm. Sometimes two. Sometimes four. Sometimes one.

**Infomercial Transitions** - Cringe questions meant to create "engagement."
- BAD: "the catch?" / "want to know the secret?" / "here's the kicker"
- FIX: If you wouldn't say it in conversation, don't write it.

**Corporate Verb Disease** - Stuffy -ing verbs.
- BAD: "highlighting the benefits" / "facilitating better outcomes"
- FIX: Use simple, active verbs. "show" not "highlighting." "help" not "facilitating."

**Hedging Language** - Clearing your throat before making a point.
- BAD: "it's worth considering..." / "it's important to note that..."
- FIX: State your opinion. Skip the diplomatic warm-up.

**Thesaurus Abuse** - Fancy words nobody uses in conversation.
- "utilize" → use
- "execute" → do
- "facilitate" → help
- "implement" → start
- "optimize" → improve
- "leverage" → use
- FIX: Write like you talk.

### Phrase Patterns to Eliminate

**"No X. No Y. Just Z."**
- BAD: "no fluff. no theory. just actionable insights."

**"The game has changed"** and cousins: "game-changer," "supercharge your [thing]"

**"Real" Overload**
- BAD: "just real strategy from real experts getting real results"
- FIX: Show authenticity through specific examples, not by repeating "real."

**Profound But Obvious** - "not because of X. but because of Y"
- BAD: "I didn't succeed because of luck. But because of hard work."
- FIX: If everyone already knows it, don't package it as insight.

**Short Hook Questions**
- BAD: "the best part?" / "want access?" / "ready to level up?"
- FIX: Ask real questions that require thought to answer.

**"Enter: [Thing]"**
- BAD: "enter: my revolutionary framework"
- FIX: Introduce the thing normally.

**"Stopped Me in My Tracks"**
- BAD: "yesterday my mentor said something that stopped me in my tracks:"
- FIX: Describe actual impact without melodrama.

**Symbol Obsession** - Telling what things "represent" instead of what happened.
- BAD: "this symbolizes..." / "which reflects..." / "emphasizing the importance of..."
- FIX: Say what happened. Say what you learned. Skip the literary analysis.

**Everything Changed**
- BAD: "the strategy that changed everything" / "this one shift transformed my entire business"
- FIX: Describe specific changes with specific metrics.

## The Core Principle

People don't stop reading bad AI content because it's inaccurate. They stop because it's forgettable.

If a sentence could appear in anyone's content, delete it.

If a phrase makes you cringe when you read it out loud, cut it.

Your voice is your moat.

## Writing Quality Checklist

**Clarity Rules (Scott Adams):**
- Cut extra words. "Very happy" → "happy"
- First sentence must grab the reader
- Short sentences. One thought each.
- Object before action. "The boy hit the ball" not "the ball was hit by the boy"

**Anti-Slop Patterns - DELETE THESE:**
- Binary contrasts: "it's not X, it's Y"
- Forced triples: "fast, efficient, reliable"
- Infomercial hooks: "the catch?" / "want to know the secret?" / "here's the kicker"
- Corporate verbs: highlighting, facilitating, leveraging, optimizing
- Hedging: "it's worth considering..." / "it's important to note..."
- Thesaurus words: utilize→use, execute→do, facilitate→help, leverage→use
- "No X. No Y. Just Z."
- "Game-changer" / "supercharge" / "everything changed"
- "Real strategy from real experts"
- Hook questions: "the best part?" / "ready to level up?"
- "Enter: [thing]"
- "Stopped me in my tracks"
- Symbol talk: "this symbolizes..." / "which reflects..."

**The Test:** Read it out loud. If it sounds like every other article, rewrite it.
