  <h1>The Billionaire Exodus: What California's Wealth Migration Actually Teaches Us About Tax Planning</h1>

  <p>Tim Draper has publicly argued that California policies have pushed enormous wealth out of the state. Whether you agree with his politics or not, the headline has staying power because the math is real: California's top marginal income tax rate is among the highest in the country.</p>

  <p>But most high-net-worth families don't have a "pick up and move" tax problem. They have a "keep more of what you already earn" problem.</p>

  <p>Relocation can matter. For many families, it's not the highest-ROI tax decision available, and it comes with costs that don't show up in a rate table. The more durable lesson from the "billionaire exodus" story is simpler:</p>

  <p><strong>After-tax, after-fee, after-behavior results are what compound.</strong> That's where we focus.</p>

  <h2>The rate differential is real. The outcome is not universal.</h2>

  <p>California's top marginal state income tax rate is 13.3% (plus the 1% Mental Health Services Tax on income over $1M). That headline number is easy to compare with states that have no wage income tax, like Texas and Florida.<br>

  <p>In a clean spreadsheet, moving from a high-tax state to a no-income-tax state can produce significant savings over time. In real life, the savings <strong>depend on</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>your income mix (W-2, pass-through, capital gains)</li>
  <li>whether gains are realized while you're still a resident</li>
  <li>how aggressively the state challenges residency</li>
  <li>property taxes, insurance, and housing costs in the destination state</li>
  <li>career and business constraints</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So yes, a family earning $2M/year can see six-figure differences in annual state income taxes. Over a decade, that can translate into seven figures. It can also translate into far less if income drops, deductions change, the family realizes large gains before establishing a new domicile, or relocation costs eat the spread.</p>

  <p><strong>The right takeaway is not "move." The right takeaway is "do the math, then weigh the life."</strong></p>

  <h2>Headlines miss the real constraint: most people are not fully mobile</h2>

  <p>The people making the news often have the highest flexibility. If you can run your business from anywhere, move your family staff, and rebuild your network on demand, geography starts to look like an optimization exercise.</p>

  <p>Most families we work with have $1–$10M (or more) invested, but their lives are not modular:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>children's schools and stability</li>
  <li>aging parents and caregiving</li>
  <li>professional network and client proximity</li>
  <li>community ties and identity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A tax plan that ignores those constraints is not a plan. It's a pitch.</p>

  <p>When we model relocation scenarios, we treat them like any other major financial decision: <strong>define the goal, quantify the tradeoffs, and reduce regret risk.</strong> The mistake is making the decision based on a marginal rate headline.</p>

  <h2>Where the meaningful tax planning lives (regardless of your ZIP code)</h2>

  <p>Relocation is one lever. Most investors get more reliable mileage from disciplined execution across the portfolio.</p>

  <p>Here are the strategies that consistently matter for high-net-worth families, with a direct note on what they can and cannot do.</p>

  <h3>1) Asset location (put the right assets in the right accounts)</h3>

  <p>Placing tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts, and tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts, can improve after-tax outcomes without changing the investment plan.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Tax-inefficient: taxable bonds, REITs, high-turnover strategies</li>
  <li>More tax-efficient: broad-market index funds, ETFs with low turnover</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Vanguard's research shows asset location <strong>can add value in some portfolios</strong>, but the benefit varies by tax rates, asset mix, and account types. In some cases it's meaningful; in others it's modest.<br>
  Source: Vanguard research on asset location and after-tax returns.<sup>2</sup></p>

  <p><strong>What to watch:</strong> Asset location is easy to talk about and harder to implement when accounts are scattered across old 401(k)s, multiple brokers, and legacy holdings. Coordination is the value.</p>

  <h3>2) Tax-loss harvesting (turn volatility into a tool)</h3>

  <p>Tax-loss harvesting is simple in concept: realize losses to offset gains (and potentially up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year), then reinvest to maintain market exposure while observing wash sale rules.</p>

  <p>Done systematically, it can create real tax assets. Done sloppily, it can create wash sales, unintended factor bets, or a portfolio that drifts.</p>

  <p>Vanguard has published estimates showing tax-loss harvesting benefits can range from <strong>near zero in some markets</strong> to <strong>meaningful in others</strong>, depending on volatility, cash flows, and the investor's tax situation. It is not a steady "every year" return boost.<br>
  Source: Vanguard research on the potential value of tax-loss harvesting.<sup>3</sup></p>

  <p><strong>A direct truth:</strong> Many years, the benefit is small. In bad years, it can be large. The strategy earns its keep over full cycles, not quarters.</p>

  <h3>3) Holding period management (stop donating short-term rates)</h3>

  <p>The spread between short-term and long-term capital gains tax rates can be large. For high earners, short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income rates; long-term gains are taxed at preferential rates (plus the NIIT where applicable). This is mechanics, not market timing.</p>

  <p>The behavioral coaching challenge is that investors like action. The tax code rewards patience.</p>

  <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We coordinate rebalancing, cash needs, and diversification with holding period thresholds, so the portfolio stays "buy the haystack" simple without paying unnecessary rates.</p>    

  <h3>4) Charitable giving (give what the IRS subsidizes most)</h3>

  <p>If philanthropy is already part of your plan, funding giving with appreciated securities can be one of the cleanest tax moves available: you may receive a charitable deduction (subject to limits) and potentially avoid realizing embedded capital gains.</p>

  <p>For many high-income families, a donor-advised fund becomes the operational hub: donate appreciated shares in high-income years, then grant over time.</p>

  <p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Letting the tax tail wag the charitable dog. Give because you want to give. Then structure it intelligently.</p>

  <h3>5) Estate planning (use today's rules while they exist)</h3>

  <p>The federal estate and gift tax exemption is historically high. For 2024, it is $13.61M per person under current law.<br>
  Source: IRS guidance (Revenue Procedure 2023-34).<sup>4</sup></p>

  <p>Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that elevated exemption is scheduled to sunset after 2025 unless Congress changes it. That is not a prediction; it's current law mechanics.</p>

  <p><strong>What this means:</strong> If you are in the "maybe taxable estate" zone, waiting can be expensive. If you are not, over-engineering can be its own form of financial self-harm. The work is matching complexity to the problem.</p>

  <h2>The hidden costs of "move for taxes"</h2>

  <p>When families analyze relocation, we push past the rate table. The real-world decision includes:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Residency rules and audit risk.</strong> States care about domicile. "I bought a condo in Florida" is not the same as "I changed my life." (This is legal and tax advice territory; your CPA and attorney matter.)</li>
  <li><strong>Property taxes and insurance.</strong> Texas can be a good example: no income tax, but higher property taxes and, in many areas, rising insurance costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Career and business friction.</strong> The best tax plan is useless if it reduces your earning power or increases business risk.</li>
  <li><strong>One-time costs.</strong> Moving, real estate transaction costs, rebuilding networks, and potential realization of gains during the transition.</li>
  <li><strong>Family stability.</strong> If the move increases stress and decreases follow-through, the plan often fails in the only way that matters: behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We call this the <em>real</em> optimizer: <strong>after-tax savings minus life disruption minus implementation risk.</strong></p>

  <h2>The compounding math that matters (illustrative, not a promise)</h2>

  <p>Fees and taxes share a brutal feature: they compound quietly.</p>

  <p>Here's the clean arithmetic, not a forecast.</p>

  <p>If a portfolio earns 6% before taxes and you improve your net return by 1% per year through better tax coordination (for example, by reducing realized gains, improving asset location, and harvesting losses when available), the difference compounds.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>$5,000,000 compounded for 25 years at 5% grows to about <strong>$16.9M</strong></li>
  <li>$5,000,000 compounded for 25 years at 6% grows to about <strong>$21.5M</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>That gap exists because compounding is unforgiving. It is also not guaranteed, because tax savings are path-dependent and tax law changes. The point is directionally true: <strong>small, repeatable improvements can matter more than dramatic, one-time moves.</strong></p>

  <p>This is also why we dislike the industry's Fee Extraction Machine. A 1% advisory fee is not "small." Over decades, it can be the difference between optionality and constraint.</p>

  <h2>The takeaway: don't outsource your plan to a headline</h2>

  <p>California's wealth migration story is real enough to study. For a subset of families, relocation is rational and worth the complexity.</p>

  <p>For most high-net-worth investors, the bigger win comes from boring competence:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>keep costs low</li>
  <li>buy the haystack, not the story</li>
  <li>coordinate taxes across the entire household balance sheet</li>
  <li>avoid behavior-driven mistakes (panic selling, performance chasing, overtrading)</li>
  <li>implement estate and charitable planning that matches your actual goals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you want to evaluate relocation, do it the same way we evaluate any major strategy: quantify the savings, enumerate the risks, and stress-test the life impact. If you want to build durable wealth, focus first on the repeatable decisions you can execute every year, in any state.</p>
