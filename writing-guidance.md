## Scott Adams: The Day You Became A Better Writer

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences.

### Core Rules

**Simple means getting rid of extra words.** Don't write "He was very happy" when you can write "He was happy." You think the word "very" adds something. It doesn't. Prune your sentences.

**Your first sentence needs to grab the reader.** Rewrite it a dozen times if necessary. It makes you curious. That's the key.

**Write short sentences.** Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren't as smart as you'd think.

**Object before action.** Readers comprehend "the boy hit the ball" quicker than "the ball was hit by the boy." Both sentences mean the same, but it's easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way.

**Humor writing is like business writing.** It needs to be simple. The main difference is word choice. For humor, don't say "drink" when you can say "swill."

## Anti-Slop Patterns

21 patterns that signal AI-generated content. Avoid these when writing. Flag them when editing.

### Structural Red Flags

**1. Binary Contrast Addiction**
The "it's not X, it's Y" structure.
- "success isn't about working hard, it's about working smart"
- "marketing isn't selling, it's storytelling"

*Fix:* Say what you mean directly. Use specific details instead of broad contrasts.

**2. Triple Threat Syndrome**
Grouping things in threes everywhere.
- "fast, efficient, reliable"
- "boost engagement, increase conversions, maximize ROI"
- "powerful, simple, transformative"

*Fix:* Vary rhythm. Sometimes two. Sometimes four. Sometimes one.

**3. Infomercial Transitions**
Cringe questions meant to create "engagement."
- "the catch?"
- "want to know the secret?"
- "the brutal truth?"
- "here's the kicker"

*Fix:* If you wouldn't say it in conversation, don't write it.

**4. Corporate Verb Disease**
Stuffy -ing verbs.
- "highlighting the benefits"
- "emphasizing critical importance"
- "facilitating better outcomes"

*Fix:* Use simple, active verbs. "show" not "highlighting." "help" not "facilitating."

**5. Hedging Language**
Clearing your throat before making a point.
- "it's worth considering..."
- "you might want to think about..."
- "it's important to note that..."

*Fix:* State your opinion. Skip the diplomatic warm-up.

**6. Thesaurus Abuse**
Fancy words nobody uses in conversation.
- "utilize" → use
- "execute" → do
- "facilitate" → help
- "implement" → start
- "optimize" → improve
- "leverage" → use

*Fix:* Write like you talk.

### Formatting Giveaways

**7. Arrow Obsession**
Overusing the → symbol.

*Fix:* One arrow per post maximum. Or none.

**8. Emoji Explosion**
Treating emojis like confetti.

*Fix:* One emoji per section. Maybe. Or none.

**9. Em Dash Overdose**
Six em dashes per paragraph.

*Fix:* Mix punctuation. Commas exist. Periods too.

### Phrase Patterns

**10. "No X. No Y. Just Z."**
- "no fluff. no theory. just actionable insights."
- "no gimmicks. no shortcuts. just results."

*Fix:* Any other sentence structure.

**11. "The game has changed"**
And its cousins: "game-changer," "supercharge your [thing]," "this changed everything."

*Fix:* Describe actual change without hyperbole.

**12. "Real" Overload**
- "just real strategy from real experts getting real results"

*Fix:* Show authenticity through specific examples, not by repeating "real."

**13. The Serious Pitch**
- "if you're serious about [goal], let's [CTA]"

*Fix:* Vary CTAs. Be specific about what happens next.

**14. "To Your Success"**
Email sign-offs that instantly reveal AI authorship.

*Fix:* Sign off like a human. "Cheers," "talk soon," or just your name.

**15. Profound But Obvious**
"not because of X. but because of Y"
- "I didn't succeed because of luck. But because of hard work."

*Fix:* If everyone already knows it, don't package it as insight.

**16. Short Hook Questions**
- "the best part?"
- "want access?"
- "ready to level up?"

*Fix:* Ask real questions that require thought to answer.

**17. "Enter: [Thing]"**
- "enter: my revolutionary framework"

*Fix:* Introduce the thing normally.

**18. "Stopped Me in My Tracks"**
- "yesterday my mentor said something that stopped me in my tracks:"

*Fix:* Describe actual impact without melodrama.

### Content Red Flags

**19. Symbol Obsession**
Telling what things "represent" instead of what happened.
- "this symbolizes..."
- "which reflects..."
- "emphasizing the importance of..."

*Fix:* Say what happened. Say what you learned. Skip the literary analysis.

**20. The Generic Case Study**
Inventing people when lacking real data. Usually named Sarah Chen.

*Fix:* Use actual examples. Real names (with permission). Real numbers.

**21. Everything Changed**
- "the strategy that changed everything"
- "this one shift transformed my entire business"

*Fix:* Describe specific changes with specific metrics.

## The Core Principle

People don't stop reading bad AI content because it's inaccurate. They stop because it's forgettable.

If a sentence could appear in anyone's content, delete it.

If a phrase makes you cringe when you read it out loud, cut it.

Your voice is your moat.
